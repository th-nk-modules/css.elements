Represents a paragraph-level thematic break. The "paragraph-level" bit means between blocks of text, so it can't be used to separate sections of a site. Instead, hr now separates different topics within a section of prose, or between scenes in a novel.

The <code>blockquote</code> element represents a section that is quoted from another source.

The li element represents a list item. If its parent element is an ol, ul, or menu element, then the element is an item of the parent element's list, as defined for those elements. Otherwise, the list item has no defined list-related relationship to any other li element.

dl

Represents a description list consisting of zero or more name-value groups. Each group must consist of one or more names (dt elements) each followed by one or more values (dd elements).
Name-value groups may be terms and definitions, metadata topics and values, or any other groups of name-value data. The values within a group are alternatives; multiple paragraphs forming part of the same value must all be given within the same dd element.

Markup:
<dl>

figure

The figure element represents some flow content, optionally with a caption, that is self-contained and is typically referenced as a single unit from the main flow of the document.
The figure element can be used to annotate illustrations, diagrams, photos, code listings, etc., that are referenced in the main content of the document, but that could, without affecting the flow of the document, be moved away from that primary content — e.g., to the side of the page, to dedicated pages, or to an appendix.
