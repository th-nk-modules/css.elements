/*
menu

The menu element represents a list of commands.
If a menu element's type attribute is in the context menu state, then the element represents the commands of a context menu, and the user can only interact with the commands if that context menu is activated. If a menu element's type attribute is in the toolbar state, then the element represents a list of active commands that the user can immediately interact with.
If a menu element's type attribute is in the list state, then the element either represents an unordered list of items (each represented by an li element), each of which represents a command that the user can perform or activate, or, if the element has no li element children, flow content describing available commands.

Markup:
<menu type="toolbar">
	<command type="command" disabled label="Save" icon="icons/save.png" onclick="save()">
	<command type="command" disabled label="Publish" icon="icons/pub.png" onclick="publish()">
</menu>
